# APDT: Aspect PHP Developement Tools #

The Aspect PHP Development Tools (APDT) project provides Eclipse platform based tool support for AOSD with PHP. Our goal is to deliver a user experience that is consistent with the PHP Development Tools ([PDT](http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/)) when working with PHPAspect projects and resources. This plugin provides an integration layer between the PHPAspect weaver, runtime and Eclipse/PDT extension points.

**Warning: APDT requires PDT 2.1.0 RC2 at least!**
**PDT 2.1.0 RC2 is available at http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/downloads/!**

APDT has the following features:

  * Support of phpAspect syntax
  * Wizards for projects, aspects and examples
  * PHPAspect weaver integration

PHPAspect and APDT are both Google Summer of Code projects, respectively in 2006 and 2007.
