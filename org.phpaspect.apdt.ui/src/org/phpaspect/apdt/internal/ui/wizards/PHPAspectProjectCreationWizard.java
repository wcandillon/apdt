 * This is a sample new wizard. Its role is to create a new file

 * (a folder or a project) is selected in the workspace 
 * when the wizard is opened, it will accept it as the target
 * container. The wizard creates one file with the extension
 * "mpe". If a sample multi-page editor (also available
 * as a template) is registered for the same extension, it will
 * be able to open it.
